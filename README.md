# FULL NPPL INSIDER — PREVIEW BUILD

> **Preview only.** This repo (`full-nppl-insider-preview`) is a test copy for review. The live app is
> https://b68yp988sw-ctrl.github.io/full-nppl-insider/ and is not changed by anything here.
> The preview is `noindex`, shows a PREVIEW badge, and uses its own service-worker cache (`nppl-preview-*`).

## What changed in this preview (29 Oct 2026)

- **Simpler layout:** home has 6 big labelled sections (Study · Practice exams · Flying skills · Plan a flight · My log · Settings), a "Continue where you left off" card, a 5-tab bottom bar (Home · Study · Exams · Skills · Plan), clear page titles and a labelled Back button, 48 px tap targets, 17 px base text and higher-contrast muted text. Every earlier screen is still reachable from a hub.
- **New logo:** home-screen icons (180/192/512 + maskable 512), black theme.
- **Full-screen opening splash (30 Oct):** on every app open the logo fills the whole screen (tall art for phones, wide art for landscape/desktop; the original logo is untouched in the centre and the web is extended to the edges), shows for about 1.2 s, fades, then goes straight to the sign-in screen (tap Continue). Tap to skip; reduced-motion users get no zoom/fade; a 2.5 s fallback means it can never get stuck. iOS home-screen launch images and the manifest colours match it, so there is no white flash. Returning users see the sign-in screen with the disclaimer already ticked.
- **Narrated circuit video** (4 min 13 s) on Flying skills → Circuits. It loads only when you tap play and is not saved offline.
- **Questions:** 352 → 402. The 50 new questions are original (`added: "2026-10-preview"`), and the answer order is now shuffled for each sitting.
- **Airfields:** 10 → 29 quick cards for south England and South Wales. Each card names its source (UK AIP AIRAC 29 Oct 2026 or the airfield's website). Blanks mean "not verified". **Always check the current AIP/website and get PPR.**
- **C42 checks:** the app's own checklist design (no photos or school branding); Useful Frequencies omitted.
- **C42 visual aids (30 Oct):** original animated illustrations ("typical" set-up) for Electrical System, Propeller, Fuel (good vs water vs debris sample) and Power Check. The current step shows the visual full width; other rows with art have a tap-to-expand thumbnail. Reduced-motion users get a still. Rows without art are unchanged.
- **More C42 external-check visuals (30 Oct):** added animated "typical" illustrations for the rest of External checks: Oil Level, Nosewheel, Doors & Undercarriage, Wings, Aileron & Flap, Baggage Compartment, Fuselage, Horizontal Stabiliser and Elevator. They are wired the same way and have reduced-motion stills. SW cache is `v5-20261030-extvisuals`.
- **Translations:** stale or half-English content was removed (it falls back to English), and the missing UI strings were added in all 7 languages. **All non-English text still needs a check by a native speaker.**
- **Bug fixes:** the exam timer kept running after you left the exam; the exam answer key was biased; airfield seeds were missing for existing users; the service worker cache was scoped wrongly; translated choices could mismatch the answer key.

npm install

```

Open **http://localhost:3850**

## Tech

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Express static server on port **3850**.

## YouTube (embeds only)

Third-party public tutorials are embedded via iframe (youtube-nocookie) with channel attribution and an Open-on-YouTube link. Videos are **not** downloaded or rehosted. Always confirm technique with your instructor.

## Content notes

- UK CAA / NPPL / SERA / CAP 413 framing only (not FAA).
- Uncertain regulatory detail marked to confirm with instructor / current AIP.
- C42 mentioned lightly; type numbers come from POH/TADS — not invented here as gospel.
- Microlight MTOW (Maximum Take-Off Weight) / empty / tanks vary by engine & approval variant — study defaults only; confirm POH/placard.
- Key UI abbreviations shown as **ABBR (meaning)** on labels (e.g. MTOW, AUW, SG, PPR, ATZ, MATZ, QNH, CHIFFTAPWE).
- Chart module uses **original schematic** swatches/symbols only — does not embed or reproduce copyrighted CAA/NATS chart artwork.
- Every practical flying module: “Not a substitute for instructor dual / POH / current UK regs.”

## Hosted web version (GitHub Pages)

Live at **https://b68yp988sw-ctrl.github.io/full-nppl-insider/** — a pure static build (all progress in the browser's localStorage, PWA/offline supported).

The in-app live METAR/TAF/NOTAM proxy (`/api/*` in `server.js`) is not part of the static build; on the hosted version the Plan-a-trip weather panel links to official sources (aviationweather.gov, Met Office, NATS) instead.

## Preview: home layout D + logo theme (30 Oct 2026)

- Home screen redesigned to mockup **D – carousel + grouped sections**: swipeable cards (Continue / Start here, Today's exam, Circuit video) with gold dots, then Study / Fly / Plan groups with clear headings and *See all* links, Settings and the disclaimer.
- Whole app re-themed to match the logo (near-black + blue→violet, silver text, gold accents, web pattern backdrop). Bigger tap targets (filter chips and YouTube links ≥48 px).
- New home labels are translated into cy, pl, fr, de, es, pt, ro — **these translations still need checking by native speakers**.
- Service worker cache bumped to `nppl-preview-v3-20261030-layoutD`.
